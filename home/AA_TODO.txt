Program Outline
    Time your program (Page 5 & 6)                          # Check_images.py                   #commit:23/07/2025      # DONE    
        Use Time Module to compute program runtime              
    Get program Inputs from the user (Page 7 & 8)       #Check_images.py, get_input_args.py     #commit:23/07/2025      #DONE
        Use command line arguments to get user inputs
    Create Pet Images Labels (Page 9, 10 & 11)          #check_images.py, get_pet_labels.py     #commit:24/07/2025      #DONE
        Use the pet images filenames to create labels
    Store the pet image labels in a data structure (e.g. dictionary)
    Create Classifier Labels and Compare Labels (Page 12 & 13)
        Use the Classifier function to classify the images and create the classifier labels
    Compare Classifier Labels to Pet Image Labels
    Store Pet Labels, Classifier Labels, and their comparison in a complex data structure (e.g. dictionary of lists)
    Classifying Labels as "Dogs" or "Not Dogs" (Page 14 & 15)
    Classify all Labels as "Dogs" or "Not Dogs" using dognames.txt file
    Store new classifications in the complex data structure (e.g. dictionary of lists)
    Calculate the Results (Page 16 & 17)
        Use Labels and their classifications to determine how well the algorithm worked on classifying images
    Print the Results (Page 18 & 19)
You will need to repeat these tasks for each of the three image classification algorithms that are provided to you.
